# Project 6 - TumblER DetailER

Submitted by: Christopher Petit

TumblER DetailER is an app that can do it all.
Within this week's project I was able to fetch 
user posts and captions. Displying the data onto
the post details and blog posts allows users to read
more in-depth into someone's post. The scrolling feature
on a post is unlocked as well as photos. I put my
own creativity on it with the use of font sizes, photo fills,
navigation bar created, etc.

The second portion of the Tumblr assignment as 
part of the iOS 2023 Dev course.

Time spent: 3 hours spent in total

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

I had the issue of caption or summary. As well as understanding how
to use the HTML clean up. I watched some videos explaining it to me 
and was able to fix and turn in my project.
